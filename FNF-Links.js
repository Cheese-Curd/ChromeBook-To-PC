	Probably won't get closed, unless they see the tab itself also may or may not work since newgrounds is blocked.
	Ungrounded is NOT blocked, at least the root directory.
	Okay so different blocker, but it is blocked so sh-t got to use KBHGames
	so, the blocked seems to be a blocker on the router, not a thing admin disabled for everyone (like a 18+ site) so there is hope that I can play FNF on the newgrounds site but honestly not likly, if twitter has this same block then I'll update and say that it is a router block, and not a extention block. SAME BLOCK! SO YES IT IS JUST BLOCKED ON THE ROUTER WOOOOoo, also funny thing it's called an "Application" cause Twitter is a web application like (big ass comment lmfao)
